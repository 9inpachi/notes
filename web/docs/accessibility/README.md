## Introduction

Accessibility is the practice of making websites usable for as many people as possible, It's not limited to people with disabilities but also people on mobile devices or slow internet connection.

### Types of Disabilities

#### Visual Impairments

Visual impairments include blindness, low-level vision or color blindness. Some people use magnifiers and some rely on screen readers.

**Screen Readers:** Screen reader is software which reads website text aloud.

The website should be built semantically and structured in a way that it's easy for people using screen readers to navigate.

#### Hairing Impairments

People have various levels of hearing loss from mild to complete deafness.

For accessibility, videos should be captioned and transcripts should be provided with audio.

#### Mobility/Movement Impairments

People with mobility impairments may have a hard time moving their limbs or maybe completely paralyzed. It could also result from hardware limitation like lack of a mouse.

Good keyboard accessibility should be provided so that websites are navigatable entirely using keyboards.

#### Cognitive Impairments

People who might be limited in their cognitive or intellectual ability. It might also be from old age when people have difficulty understanding and remembering things.

Accessibility for people with cognitive impairments can be improved keeping in mind the following:

- Presenting content through video or text-to-speech
- Easily understandable content
- Focus important content by making it bold, italic and using other visual techniques
- Have consistent layout
- Make authentication easy and simple
- Forms are easy to complete with meaningful errors
