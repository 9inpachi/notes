# Test Driven Development (TDD)

A software development process in which test cases are written first which initially fail. After that, implementation is done to make the test cases pass.

## Test Driven Development Cycle

1. Add a new test.
2. Run all tests and the the new test should fail.
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test.
4. Run all tests and they should pass.
5. Refactor the code and make sure that tests still pass.
