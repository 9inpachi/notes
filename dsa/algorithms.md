## Linearly Scalable Algorithms

The solution size grows linearly with the problem. If we increase the input size, the longer it takes to execute the program. For example, sum of 10^11 with for loop.

## Constant Time Algorithms

An algorithm that can solve a problem or input of larger scale in the same time. For example, using the formula `N * (N + 1) / 2` to get sum of 10^11.

## Asymptotic Analysis

The analysis of change in performance of an algorithm with the change in the size/order of input.

### Asymptotic Notations

Notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input is worst-case, best-case or average.

#### Big-O Notation

Big-O notation gives the upper bound of the running of an algorithm aka it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
