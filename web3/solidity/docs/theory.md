#### EIP: Ethereum Improvement Proposals

Formal documents used to propose new features, standards, or improvements for the Ethereum ecosystem. It could be anything from technical enhancement to a block to standard for best practice.

All other chains also have some sort of structure for improvement proposals.

#### ERC: Ethereum Request for Comments

ERC are a subset of EIP. They specifically define application level standards mostly for smart contracts and tokens. They are numbered chronologically based on when they are proposed.

Examples are:

- ERC-20: Standard for fungible tokens.
- ERC-721: Standard for NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
- ERC-1155: Multi-token standard (fungible + non-fungible in one contract).
